# SourceCode_Hertaeg19

To reproduce the results shown in the paper *Amplifying the redistribution of somato-dendritic inhibition by the interplay of three interneuron types.*, you need to run the *Make_Fig_\*.py* files.

These files import python packages and customized functions from the folder **Functions**, define simulation parameters that can be changed if needed, run the respective simulations and finally plot (and save) the data.

The folder **Functions** contains the core code to initialize, run and analyse the networks.

The folder **Plots** will contain all the figures after the *Make_Fig_\*.py* files have been run successfully.

Please note that the present code is not optimized. Also, if you encounter any problems, do not hesitate to contact the authors anytime.
